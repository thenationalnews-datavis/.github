# The National

## Who we are

The National was founded in 2008, setting a new standard for quality journalism in the Middle East.

Each day The National reaches an influential, English-speaking audience from our headquarters in Abu Dhabi to deliver the latest in news, business, arts, culture, lifestyle and sports, while leading the region in analytical content and commentary.

The National is committed to serving the local UAE community while delivering a strong international perspective to a growing audience beyond.

With bureaux in Beirut, Cairo, London and Washington, and correspondents in key cities in the Mena region and worldwide, The National has developed a reputation for providing in-depth coverage and a window into the region.

The National has been extensively awarded for its design, reporting, photography and video work.

Publishing across all digital platforms – reaching millions of readers, listeners and viewers each month - The National harnesses the latest multimedia tools while continuing to produce a print edition five days a week, distributed in the UAE.

The National was originally launched as part of Abu Dhabi Media, before being acquired by International Media Investments and relaunched in 2017.

The National is the destination to understand the Middle East at a time when the region has never been more important
